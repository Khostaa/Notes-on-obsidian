- Success on the outside means nothing unless you also have success within.
- Self-mastery and the consistent care of one's mind, body and soul are essential to finding one's highest self and living the life of one's dreams.
- How can you care for others if you cannot even care for yourself? How can you do good if you don't even feel good? I can't love you if I cannot love myself.
- how can any more go in. . .   until you first empty your cup?
- Investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make.

- mental mastery comes through conditioning, nothing more and nothing less.
- When you dedicate yourself to transforming your inner world your life quickly shifts from the ordinary into the realm of the extraordinary.
- There is no such thing as objective reality or 'the real world'
	- There are no absolutes. The face of your greatest enemy might be the face of my finest friend. An event that appears to be a tragedy to one might reveal the seeds of unlimited opportunity to another. What really separates people who are habitually upbeat and optimistic from those who are consistently miserable is how
	 the circumstances of life are interpreted and processed."
- No matter what happens to you in your life, you alone have the capacity to choose your response to it. When you form the habit of searching for the positive in every circumstance, your life will move into its highest dimensions. This is one of the greatest of all the natural laws
- Perspective matters - you either see the glass half full or half empty.
- By controlling the thoughts that you think and the way you respond to the events of your life, you begin to control your destiny.
- there is a bright side to the darkest circumstance — if you have the courage to look for it.
- 'There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.'
- To transcend pain, you must first experience it. Or to put it another way, how can you really know the joy of being on the summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowest valley.
- stop judging events as either positive or negative. Rather, simply experience them, celebrate them and learn from them.
- the laws of nature always ensure that when one door closes another opens.
- begin to live out of the glory of your imagination, not your memory.
- Dare to dream that you are more than the sum of your current circumstances. Expect the best. You will be astonished at the results.
- *When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of your thoughts break their bonds: your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.*
- "The mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master. If you have become a negative thinker, this is because you have not cared for your mind and taken the time to train it to focus on the good. the mind truly is like any other muscle in your body. Use it or lose it."
- 'The boundaries of your life are merely creations of the self.'
- Persistence is the mother of personal change.
- **enjoy the process of personal expansion and growth. Ironically, the less you focus on the end result, the quicker it will come.**
- '"The answer is simple. With one eye fixed on the destination, there is only one left to guide you along the journey'"
- concentration is at the root of mental mastery.
- to liberate the power of the mind, you must first be able to harness it and direct its focus only to the task at hand. The moment you concentrate the focus of your mind on a singular purpose, extraordinary gifts will appear within your life.
- When you concentrate minds' tremendous power on definite, meaningful objectives, you will quickly ignite the flames of your personal potential and produce startling results.
- the secret of happiness is simple:  *find out what you truly love to do and then direct all of your energy towards doing it.*
- When you figure out what your main aim or destiny
really is, you will never have to work another day in your life.
- "All that you need to perform this exercise is a fresh rose and a silent place. Natural surroundings are best but a quiet room will also do nicely. Start to stare at the center of the rose, its heart.
	Yogi Raman told me that a rose is very much like life: you will meet thorns along the way but if you have faith and believe in your dreams you will eventually move beyond the thorns into the glory of the flower. Keep staring at the rose. Notice its color, texture and design. Savor its fragrance and think only about this wonderful object in front of you. At first, other thoughts will start entering your mind, distracting you from the heart of the rose.
	This is the mark of an untrained mind. But you need not worry, improvement will come quickly. Simply return your attention to the object of your focus. Soon your mind will grow strong and disciplined." Page 46/54 (half page open)
- 'One must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle — and a mystery.'
- "Persist and spend longer and longer periods savoring the heart of the rose," Julian continued in his throaty tone. "After a week or two you should be able to perform the technique for twenty minutes without your mind wandering onto other subjects.
- *Never forget that there is power in silence and stillness. Stillness is the stepping stone to connecting with  t h e universal source of intelligence that throbs through every living thing.*
- under the grand laws of Nature, the mind can only hold one thought at any one time.
- Using this little-known information, anyone can easily create a positive, creative mindset within a short period. The process is straightforward: when an undesirable thought occupies the focal point of your mind, immediately replace it with a uplifting one. It's as if your mind is a giant slide projector, with every thought in your mind being a slide. Whenever a negative slide comes up on the screen, take swift action to replace it with a positive one.
- "Thoughts are vital, living things, little bundles of energy, if you will. Most people don't give any thought to the nature of their thoughts and yet, the quality of your thinking determines the quality of your life. Thoughts are just as much a part of the material world as the lake you swim in or the street you walk on. Weak minds lead to weak actions. A strong, disciplined mind, which anyone can cultivate through daily practice, can achieve miracles. If you want to live life to the fullest, care for your thoughts as you would your most prized possessions. Work hard to remove all inner turbulence. The rewards will be abundant."
- everything is always created twice, first in the mind and then in reality.

# Secret of the Lake
- To apply it, these teachers would rise at 4:00 a.m.
 - the sages would look into the waters of the still lake and envision their dreams becoming reality.
 - visualize mental pictures of all that you want to be, to have and to attain in your life.

# book
- the mind works through pictures.
- If your self-image tells you that you are too young to be a successful lawyer or too old to change your habits for the better, you never will achieve these goals. If your self-image tells you that lives rich with purpose, excellent health and happiness are only for people from backgrounds other than your own, this prophecy will ultimately become your reality.
- "But when you run inspiring, imaginative pictures through the movie screen of your mind, wonderful things start to happen in your life. Einstein said that 'imagination is more important than knowledge.' You must spend some time every day, even if it is just a few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. See yourself as you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, a great father or a great citizen of your community."
- Understand once and for all that your mind has magnetic power to attract all that you desire into your life. If there is a lack in your life it is because there is a lack in your thoughts.
- Even one negative image is poisonous to your mindset.

- 'There is nothing noble about being superior to some other person. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.'
- It doesn't matter what other people say about you. What is important is what you say to yourself. Do not be concerned with the judgment of others as long as you know what you are doing is right.
- for God's sake, never get into the petty habit of measuring your self-worth against other people's net worth.
- 'Every second you spend thinking about someone else's dreams you take time away from your own.'
- When you consistently direct your mind to live in the present you will always have boundless energy, no matter what time the clock reflects.

- Master your mind
- You have now learned that the mind is like a fertile garden and for it to flourish, you must nurture it daily. Never let the weeds of impure thought and action take the garden of your mind. Stand guard at the gateway of your mind. Keep it healthy and strong — it will work miracles in your life if you will only let it.
- *the purpose of life is a life of purpose.*
- Clearly defined priorities and goals for every aspect of your life will serve a role similar to that played by a lighthouse, offering you guidance and refuge when the seas become rough.
- anyone can revolutionize their lives once they revolutionize the direction in which they are moving.
- But if you don't even know where you are going, how will you ever know when you get there?
- the real source of happiness can be stated in a word: *achievement.* Lasting happiness comes from steadily working to accomplish your goals and advancing confidently in the direction of your life's purpose.
- when you clearly know what aims you wish to achieve over the course of your life, be they material, emotional, physical or spiritual, and you spend your days accomplishing them, you will ultimately find eternal joy.
- But you must know your life's aim and then manifest this vision into reality by consistent action. We sages call this Dharma, which is the Sanskrit word for life's purpose.
- The happiness you are searching for comes through reflecting on the worthy aims you are dedicated to achieving and then taking action daily to advance them.
- This is a direct application of the timeless philosophy which prescribes that those things which are most important should never be sacrificed to those things which are the least important.
- The key is to have the discipline and vision to see your heroic mission and to ensure that it serves other people while you realize it.
- Goal-setting is the starting point. Mapping out your objectives and your goals releases the creative juices which get you on to the path of your purpose. Believe it or not,
- *you will never be able to hit a target that you cannot see.*
- People spend their whole lives dreaming of becoming happier, living with more vitality and having an abundance of passion. Yet they do not see the importance of taking even ten minutes a month to write out their goals and to think deeply about the meaning of their lives, their Dharma. Goal setting will make your life magnificent. Your world will become richer, more delightful and more magical.
- Anyone who wishes to improve the quality of their inner as well as their outer worlds would do well to take out a piece of paper and start writing out their life aims. At the very moment that this is done, natural forces will come into play which start to transform these dreams into reality.
- Know your outcome
- You change your life the moment you set your goals and start to seek out your Dharma.
- Concentrate every ounce of your mental energy on self-discovery. Learn what you excel at and what makes you happy. Maybe you are practicing law but are really meant to be a school teacher, given your patience and love of teaching. Perhaps you are a frustrated painter or sculptor. Whatever it is, find your passion and then follow it.
- when you decide to start concentrating your mind on your life's main aims, your mind starts to filter out the unimportant and focus only on the important.
- we are shaped and fashioned by what we love.
- there is nothing wrong with mapping out a full range of smaller goals in the process of planning your bigger ones.
- "The main reason people do not follow through on any resolutions they make is that it is too easy to slip back into their old ways. Pressure is not always a bad thing. Pressure can inspire you to achieve great ends. People generally achieve magnificent things when their backs are up against the wall and they are forced to tap into the wellspring of human potential that lies within them.
- when you train your mind to associate pleasure with good habits and punishment with bad ones, your weaknesses will quickly fall by the wayside.
- Step one: to have a clear vision of your outcome
- step two: to create positive pressure to keep you inspired
- step three: never set a goal without attaching a timeline to it.
- To breathe life into a goal you must attach a precise deadline to it.
- "remember that a goal that is not committed to paper is no goal at all. Go out and buy a journal — a cheap coil notepad will do. Call this your Dream Book and fill it with all your desires, objectives and dreams. Get to know yourself and what you are all about."
- "Don't I already know myself?" 
	- "Most people don't. They have never taken the time to know their strengths, their weaknesses, their hopes, their dreams.
- There are three mirrors that form a person's reflection:
	- first is how you see yourself
	- second is how others see you
	- third mirror reflects the truth
- "Divide your Dream Book into separate sections for goals relating to the different areas of your life. For example you might have sections for your physical fitness goals, your financial goals, your personal empowerment goals, your relationship and social goals and, perhaps most importantly, your spiritual goals."
- fill your Dream Book with pictures of the things you desire and images of people who have cultivated the abilities, talents and qualities that you hope to emulate. Getting back to you and your 'spare tire,' if you want to lose weight and be in outstanding physical shape, paste a picture of a marathon runner or an elite athlete in your Dream Book. If you want to be the world's finest husband, why not clip out a picture of someone who represents this — perhaps your father — and put it into your journal in the relationship section. If you are dreaming of a mansion by the sea or a sports car, find an inspiring picture of these objects and use them for your book of dreams. Then review this book daily, even for a few minutes. Make it your friend. The results will startle you.
- Once you have formed a clear mental picture of your outcome, created a little pressure behind it, set a deadline and committed it to paper, the next step is to apply what Yogi Raman called The Magic Rule of 21. The learned men and women of his world believed that, for new behavior to crystallize into a habit, one had to perform the new activity for twenty-one days in a row."
- "The only way to permanently install a new habit is to direct so much energy toward it that the old one slips away like an unwelcome house guest. The installation is generally complete in about twenty-one days, the time it takes to create a new neural pathway."

- **never do anything because you have to. The only reason to do something is because you want to and because you know it is the right thing for you to do.**

- when you insert any activity into your routine by doing it the same way at the same time every day, it quickly grows into a habit.
- Enjoy the process.
- a day without laughter or a day without love was a day without life.
- make sure that you have fun while you are advancing along the path of your goals and purpose. Never forget the importance of living with unbridled exhilaration.

- There is no chaos in this Universe. There is a purpose for everything that has ever happened to you, and everything that will happen to you. Remember what I told you, John. Every experience offers lessons. So stop majoring in minor things. Enjoy your life.

- A burning sense of passion is the most potent fuel for your dreams.

- We do not do things because we love to do them. We do things because we feel we have to do them. This is a formula for misery.

- What I am talking about is a passion for life. Reclaim the joy of waking up every morning, full of energy and exhilaration. Breathe the fire of passion into all that you do. You will quickly reap great material, as well as spiritual, rewards

- From tonight onwards, take complete control of your life. Decide, once and for all, to be the master of your fate. Run your own race. Discover your calling and you will start to experience the ecstacy of an inspired life. Finally, *always remember that what lies behind you and what lies in front of you is nothing when compared to what lies within you.*
