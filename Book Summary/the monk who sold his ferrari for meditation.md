- mental mastery comes through conditioning, nothing more and nothing less.
- When you dedicate yourself to transforming your inner world your life quickly shifts from the ordinary into the realm of the extraordinary.
- There is no such thing as objective reality or 'the real world'
	- There are no absolutes. The face of your greatest enemy might be the face of my finest friend. An event that appears to be a tragedy to one might reveal the seeds of unlimited opportunity to another. What really separates people who are habitually upbeat and optimistic from those who are consistently miserable is how
	 the circumstances of life are interpreted and processed."
- No matter what happens to you in your life, you alone have the capacity to choose your response to it. When you form the habit of searching for the positive in every circumstance, your life will move into its highest dimensions. This is one of the greatest of all the natural laws
- Perspective matters - you either see the glass half full or half empty.
- By controlling the thoughts that you think and the way you respond to the events of your life, you begin to control your destiny.
- there is a bright side to the darkest circumstance — if you have the courage to look for it.
- 'There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.'
- To transcend pain, you must first experience it. Or to put it another way, how can you really know the joy of being on the summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowest valley.
- stop judging events as either positive or negative. Rather, simply experience them, celebrate them and learn from them.
- the laws of nature always ensure that when one door closes another opens.
- begin to live out of the glory of your imagination, not your memory.
- Dare to dream that you are more than the sum of your current circumstances. Expect the best. You will be astonished at the results.
- *When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of your thoughts break their bonds: your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.*
- "The mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master. If you have become a negative thinker, this is because you have not cared for your mind and taken the time to train it to focus on the good. the mind truly is like any other muscle in your body. Use it or lose it."
- 'The boundaries of your life are merely creations of the self.'
- Persistence is the mother of personal change.
- **enjoy the process of personal expansion and growth. Ironically, the less you focus on the end result, the quicker it will come.**
- '"The answer is simple. With one eye fixed on the destination, there is only one left to guide you along the journey'"
- concentration is at the root of mental mastery.
- to liberate the power of the mind, you must first be able to harness it and direct its focus only to the task at hand. The moment you concentrate the focus of your mind on a singular purpose, extraordinary gifts will appear within your life.
- When you concentrate minds' tremendous power on definite, meaningful objectives, you will quickly ignite the flames of your personal potential and produce startling results.

- "All that you need to perform this exercise is a fresh rose and a silent place. Natural surroundings are best but a quiet room will also do nicely. Start to stare at the center of the rose, its heart.
	Yogi Raman told me that a rose is very much like life: you will meet thorns along the way but if you have faith and believe in your dreams you will eventually move beyond the thorns into the glory of the flower. Keep staring at the rose. Notice its color, texture and design. Savor its fragrance and think only about this wonderful object in front of you. At first, other thoughts will start entering your mind, distracting you from the heart of the rose.
	This is the mark of an untrained mind. But you need not worry, improvement will come quickly. Simply return your attention to the object of your focus. Soon your mind will grow strong and disciplined." Page 46/54 (half page open)
- 'One must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle — and a mystery.'
- "Persist and spend longer and longer periods savoring the heart of the rose," Julian continued in his throaty tone. "After a week or two you should be able to perform the technique for twenty minutes without your mind wandering onto other subjects.
- *Never forget that there is power in silence and stillness. Stillness is the stepping stone to connecting with  t h e universal source of intelligence that throbs through every living thing.*
- under the grand laws of Nature, the mind can only hold one thought at any one time.
- Using this little-known information, anyone can easily create a positive, creative mindset within a short period. The process is straightforward: when an undesirable thought occupies the focal point of your mind, immediately replace it with a uplifting one. It's as if your mind is a giant slide projector, with every thought in your mind being a slide. Whenever a negative slide comes up on the screen, take swift action to replace it with a positive one.
- "Thoughts are vital, living things, little bundles of energy, if you will. Most people don't give any thought to the nature of their thoughts and yet, the quality of your thinking determines the quality of your life. Thoughts are just as much a part of the material world as the lake you swim in or the street you walk on. Weak minds lead to weak actions. A strong, disciplined mind, which anyone can cultivate through daily practice, can achieve miracles. If you want to live life to the fullest, care for your thoughts as you would your most prized possessions. Work hard to remove all inner turbulence. The rewards will be abundant."
- everything is always created twice, first in the mind and then in reality.

- the mind works through pictures.
- If your self-image tells you that you are too young to be a successful lawyer or too old to change your habits for the better, you never will achieve these goals. If your self-image tells you that lives rich with purpose, excellent health and happiness are only for people from backgrounds other than your own, this prophecy will ultimately become your reality.
- "But when you run inspiring, imaginative pictures through the movie screen of your mind, wonderful things start to happen in your life. Einstein said that 'imagination is more important than knowledge.' You must spend some time every day, even if it is just a few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. See yourself as you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, a great father or a great citizen of your community."
- Understand once and for all that your mind has magnetic power to attract all that you desire into your life. If there is a lack in your life it is because there is a lack in your thoughts.
- Even one negative image is poisonous to your mindset.

- 'There is nothing noble about being superior to some other person. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.'

- for God's sake, never get into the petty habit of measuring your self-worth against other people's net worth.
- 'Every second you spend thinking about someone else's dreams you take time away from your own.'
- When you consistently direct your mind to live in the present you will always have boundless energy, no matter what time the clock reflects.

- Master your mind
