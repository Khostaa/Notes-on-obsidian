- Texture - Physical quality of surface
	- adds depth and tactility to otherwise flat images
- Objects can appear smooth, rough, hard, soft depending on elements at play
- Too much texture in single design could be overwhelming.

# Graphic Design Fundamentals
## Balance
- equal distribution of visual weights
- can be affected by color, size, number and negative space.
### Symmetrical designs
- are same or similar on both side of an axis
### Asymmetrical designs
- different but weight is still evenly distributed
- Composition is balanced because it calls attention to right things.

## Rule of thirds
- objects at intersection of lines or horizontal axis in alignment with one of the horizontal lines.

# Branding and Identity
