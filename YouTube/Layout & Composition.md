It is the foundation of design
# Principles
## Proximity:
- using visual space to show relationships in your content
- related items group together
- groups not related should be separated, to visually emphasize their lack of relationship

## White Space
- i.e, negative space like the space between your content, between lines and even the outer margins
- helps you define and separate different sections
- gives content a room to breathe
- if work feel cluttered, little whitespace can work.

## Alignment
- makes composition easier to navigate

## Contrast
- one item is different from another.
- helps to catch readers eyes
- create emphasis
- call attention to something important
- different strategies to create contrast
- color, size, shape, visual weight of object or use contrasting styles of text

## Hierarchy
- visual technique to let your viewer navigate your work
- shows where to begin, where to go next using different levels of emphasis

## Repetition
- reminder that every project should have consistent look and feel
- makes work easier to read
- when viewers know what to expect, they can relax and focus on content
